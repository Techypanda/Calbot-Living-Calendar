# Living Calendar - Cal - Curtin Game Dev

This lambda spins up a discord bot (Cal) on the curtin game dev discord server which will read a google sheet the committee have edited to post a new calendar.

# How To Modify

Change the livingcal.js and deploy to AWS via SAM cli.

# Todo

Maybe make a pipeline but I can't see the need, its such a simple script that its not really worth it
